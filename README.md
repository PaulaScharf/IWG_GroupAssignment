# IWG - GroupAssignment
This Project informs about the current status of the oak processionary moth plague in Münster. It does so by visualizing the trees around you in Augmented Reality and providing their status of affectedness. Below is a link to a mobile web app where you can look at the result of this AR project.

### Features
#### Trees
The main feature of this web app are the trees. They are based on data from the tree cadastre of Münster but also hold information about the status of their infestaion with the processionary moth. The trees are visualized in AR as basic sketches, as seen in the table below.

|| healthy        | possibly affected  | affected  |
|:-----------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-----:|
|primary model| tree sketch      | tree sketch | tree sketch |
|secondary model| dot      | questionmark      |   exclamationmark |

When you look at a tree it changes its visualization to the secondary model, an Infobox with information about the tree opens and the distance to the tree is displayed at the top of the screen.

#### Infobox

In the image above you can see the initial content view of the infobox. On the right you can change the infestation-status of the corresponding tree. On the left you have a menu from which you can either change to the content view that contains basic characteristics or to the view that holds an image of the tree/infestation. The characteristics are editable, but editing the image does not work currently.

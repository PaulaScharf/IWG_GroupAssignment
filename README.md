# IWG - GroupAssignment
This Project informs about the current status of the oak processionary moth plague in Münster. It does so by visualizing the trees around you in Augmented Reality and providing their status of affectedness. Below is a link to a mobile web app where you can look at the result of this AR project.

### Features
#### Trees
The main feature of this web app are the trees. They are based on data from the tree cadastre of Münster. Information about the infestation status of a tree has to be added by the users. The trees are visualized in AR as basic sketches, as seen below.
